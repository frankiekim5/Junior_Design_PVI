# Demo App
This is the demo app developed by MedX for our class Junior Design and our client, Gavin Max for **Personal Virtual Inventories**. It is a web app running on Flask using Pure HTML/JS/CSS.

## Development
The following technologies were used to develop this prototype:
* `HTML/JS/CSS` for the frontend (no Bootstrap, React, etc)
* `Python` (`Flask`/`Jinja`) for the backend
  * (Python >=3.7, untested but should be backwards compatible up to 2.6)
* Potentially `sqlite3`

## Getting started
To get started running and developing for this app, follow these steps:
* Install Python
* Install pip
* Run `pip install flask`
  * A virtualenvironment is suggested
* To run the app, run the command `python app.py` in the this (demo) directory
* You will now be able to visit `127.0.0.1:5000` and view the app
